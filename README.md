# Self-teaching Rust

This is the repository that'll hold the files I create in my process of learning **Rust**!

Currently, the path I am taking in learning Rust is by coding several programs:

[x] 1. <u>**Hello World**</u>: this will give me a first taste of Rust and let me see how the workflow of compiling and running a Rust program, as well as basic IO.

[x] 2. <u>**Change Maker**</u>: this will let me learn how to assign variables of different types, casting, getting user input and assigning them to variables, and formatting print statements.

[ ] 3. <u>**Number Guesser**</u>: add in some conditional statements and loops

[ ] 4. <u>**Cesar Cypher**</u>: work with functions, arrays, and string manipulation

[ ] 5. <u>**Horse Race**</u>: OOP, classes

[ ] 6. <u>**GUI app**</u>: BMI calculator? Volume calculator? idk I'll think of something lol
