# Self-teaching Rust

This is the repository that'll hold the files I create in my process of learning **Rust**!

Currently, the path I am taking in learning Rust is by coding several programs:

[x] 1. **Hello World**: this will give me a first taste of Rust and let me see how the workflow of compiling and running a Rust program, as well as basic IO.

[x]2.  **Change Maker**: this will let me learn how to assign variables of different types, casting, getting user input and assigning them to variables, and formatting print statements.

[ ]3.  **Number Guesser**: add in some conditional statements and loops

[ ]4. **Cesar Cypher**: work with functions, arrays, and string manipulation

[ ]5. **Horse Race**: OOP, classes

[ ]6. **GUI app**: BMI calculator? Volume calculator? idk I'll think of something lol
