# Self-teaching Rust

This is the repository that'll hold the files I create in my process of learning **Rust**!

Currently, the path I am taking in learning Rust is by coding several programs:

[x] 1. <ins>**Hello World**</ins>: this will give me a first taste of Rust and let me see how the workflow of compiling and running a Rust program, as well as basic IO.

[x] 2. <ins>**Change Maker**</ins>: this will let me learn how to assign variables of different types, casting, getting user input and assigning them to variables, and formatting print statements.

[ ] 3. <ins>**Number Guesser**</ins>: add in some conditional statements and loops

[ ] 4. <ins>**Cesar Cypher**</ins>: work with functions, arrays, and string manipulation

[ ] 5. <ins>**Horse Race**</ins>: OOP, classes

[ ] 6. <ins>**GUI app**</ins>: BMI calculator? Volume calculator? idk I'll think of something lol
